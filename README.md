# ToonTown Corporate Clash Auto Golf
This is a program that automates the golfing process in ToonTown Corporate Clash. The program will not work on ToonTown Rewritten, as it uses image recognition and pixel location for clicks/movement. The program does not inject code into ToonTown; it analyzes the user's screen for pre-taken screenshots (located in a folder within the program) and then simulates mouse movement/clicks and keyboard movement.

# Execution
Program is controlled with a GUI that will appear when the exe file has been opened. When the start button is clicked, the GUI will notify the user the program has started and the Auto-Golfer will begin. To stop the program, simply click the stop button located on the GUI.  More detailed instructions for usage and setup are included in the [INSTRUCTIONS](https://github.com/floopergobber/ToonTown-Corporate-Clash-Auto-Golf/wiki/INSTRUCTIONS) page.
