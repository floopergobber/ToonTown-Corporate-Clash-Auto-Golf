# ToonTown Corporate Clash Auto Golf
This is a program that automates the golfing process in ToonTown Corporate Clash. The program will not work on ToonTown Rewritten, as it uses image recognition and pixel location for clicks/movement. The program does not inject code into ToonTown; it analyzes the user's screen for pre-taken screenshots (located in a folder within the program) and then simulates mouse movement/clicks and keyboard movement.

# Execution
Program is controlled with a GUI that will appear when the exe file has been opened. When the start button is clicked, the GUI will notify the user the program has started and the Auto-Golfer will begin. To stop the program, simply click the stop button located on the GUI.  More detailed instructions for usage and setup are included in the INSTRUCTIONS section below.

   NOTE: There are a few settings in Corporate Clash to tweak for the program to run properly.
    
      1: The Aspect Ratio MUST be set to 16:9 for the program to click the right locations and identify images properly. 
          
      2: Resolution MUST be set to 1600x900, as some of the click functions are set to pixel locations, and a different resolution will result in innaccurate/missed clicks.
          
      3: Schtickerbook size MUST be set to Large, same reason as #2 on the list.
          
      4: The rest of the settings should not matter, Anti-Aliasing, Antisotropic Filtering, FPS Meter, etc should have no effect on the program's accuracy.
              
              
      5: You should click the start button once you have entered the Minigames Area Playground. The camera view MUST be on the furthest out setting while in spawn for the image recognition to properly work. The program will automatically do this 2 seconds after the start button is clicked.
      
      NOTE: You can easily change/reset the camera angle by pressing the F2 key (default key). By default your Toon should load in with the camera angle the same every time. Simply press the F2 key twice to set the camera angle properly upon loading in if the program does not adjust it automatically. If the camera angle becomes altered, switch it back by pressing F2 until the camera angle is the farthest out again.
