# ToonTown Corporate Clash Auto Golf
Automated Golf system for ToonTown Corporate Clash. Program will not work on ToonTown Rewritten, as it uses image recognition and pixel location for clicks/movement. The program does not inject code into ToonTown, rather it analyzes the user's screen for pre-taken screenshots (located in a folder within the program) and then simulates mouse movement/clicks and keyboard movement.
