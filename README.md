# ToonTown Corporate Clash Auto Golf
Automated Golf system for ToonTown Corporate Clash. Program will not work on ToonTown Rewritten, as it uses image recognition and pixel location for clicks/movement. The program does not inject code into ToonTown, rather it analyzes the user's screen for pre-taken screenshots (located in a folder within the program) and then simulates mouse movement/clicks and keyboard movement.

# Execution
Program is run via the exe file located inside the "MAIN" folder. Program does not require any additional downloads other than the "MAIN" folder and its contents. Program is run in Python and packaged with cx_Freeze for ease of use. Upon opening the .exe file, labeled [INSERT FINAL NAME HERE], a GUI (see first image below) will appear. When the start button is clicked, the GUI will notify the user the program has started and the Auto-Golfer will begin. More detailed instructions for usage and setup are included in the INSTRUCTIONS section.
