# INSTRUCTIONS
For the program to run properly, follow the list below.

1. Download the Auto Golfer ZIP file and open the archive/extract the files. (you can use whatever program you have to extract zip folders, ie. 7zip, winRAR, etc..)

2. Drag the Auto Golfer folder onto your desktop (or other desired location)

3. Open the Auto Golfer folder and open the Auto Golf.exe program.

4. Click the Start button on the GUI to begin the Auto Golf program.
    NOTE: There are a few settings in Corporate Clash to tweak for the program to run properly.
          1: The Aspect Ratio MUST be set to 16:9 for the program to click the right locations and identify images properly. 
          2: Resolution MUST be set to 1600x900, as some of the click functions are set to pixel locations, and a different resolution will result in innaccurate/missed clicks.
          3: Schtickerbook size MUST be set to Large, same reason as #2 on the list.
          4: The rest of the settings should not matter, Anti-Aliasing, Antisotropic Filtering, FPS Meter, etc should have no effect on the programa accuracy.
              Note: I have tested the program with most of the settings changed, but have not experimented with Vertical Sync or Legacy Content Pack Support enabled. I have them disabled by default.
